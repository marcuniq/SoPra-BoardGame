## "Camel Up" Board Game

In a group of 5 students, we had to implement the board game "Camel Up", where the logic had to reside on a RESTful server, and several players could play the game on an Android client.

My take aways:
* got to know new technologies and concepts (Spring Boot, Android, CI/CD, Pusher, Gradle)
* improved knowledge of technologies and concepts (PaaS, REST)
* improved software engineering skills (Git, agile development, architecture modelling)
* working in a group is not easy

We used Apiary API blueprint to document our API: [docs.sopra.apiary.io](http://docs.sopra.apiary.io)
